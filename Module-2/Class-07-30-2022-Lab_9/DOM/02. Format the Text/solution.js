You need to create a new paragraph element which holds no more than 3 sentences from the given input.
â€¢ If the given input contains less or 3 sentences, you need to create only 1 paragraph, fill it with these
sentences and append this paragraph to the div with an id "output".
Otherwise, when you have more than 3 sentences in that input paragraph, you need to create enough paragraphs
to get all sentences from the input text.
Just remember to restrict the sentences in each paragraph to 3.
